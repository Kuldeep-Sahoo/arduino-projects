# Kuldeep-Sahoo's Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository! This repository contains various projects and experiments related to electronics and sensor integration using Arduino. Below is a brief description of each project included in this repository.

## Table of Contents

#################################### DAY_1 AND DAY_2 ARE THEORY CLASSES #################################################

#################### DAY 3 ######################

## 3 LED Blink
This project demonstrates how to blink three LEDs in a sequence. It is a basic example of using digital outputs on an Arduino.

## Basic LED
This project shows how to connect and control a single LED with an Arduino.

## LED Intensity Control
This project demonstrates how to control the brightness of an LED using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

## LED with Condition

This project includes conditional statements to control an LED. The LED will turn on or off based on specific conditions.

################### DAY 4 #######################

## Dice
This project simulates a dice roll using an Arduino, providing a random number between 1 and 6.

## Random Value
This project demonstrates generating and displaying random values with an Arduino.

## IR Sensor with 1 LED
This project uses an IR sensor to control a single LED. The LED turns on when the IR sensor detects an object and turned off when there is no object detected;

## IR Sensor with 2 LEDs
This project uses an IR sensor to control two LED. The 1st LED turns on when the IR sensor detects an object and 2nd LED turns on when there is no object detected;

################### DAY 5 #######################

## Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT)
This project interfaces a DHT sensor with an Arduino to read temperature and humidity values.

## Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion with DHT
This project extends the temperature and humidity sensor project by converting the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

################### DAY 6 #######################

## 7_LED
This project demonstrates how to control seven LEDs in various patterns using an Arduino. The LEDs can be blinked in sequences, used to display numbers or characters, or controlled to create dynamic light effects.

 ## ADD_DIFFERENT_RANGES_FOR_SOIL_MOISTURE_SENSOR
This project involves interfacing a soil moisture sensor with an Arduino and setting up different ranges to categorize the soil moisture level (e.g., dry, moist, wet). The Arduino will read the sensor data and output corresponding signals or messages based on the moisture level.

## Soil Moisture Test
This project involves interfacing a soil moisture sensor with an Arduino to measure the moisture level in the soil. The Arduino will read the sensor data and display the moisture level, which can be used to determine whether the soil is dry, moist, or wet. This is useful for applications like automated irrigation systems and plant care monitoring.
